    <p>i'm planning to... film? the background... or animation... i don't know what this counts as but i'm doing it at a park near my house where there are big benches i like to go to.</p>
    <img id="small" src="../photos/p2/IMG_0152.png">
    <p>i have now filmed the background, now i <i>should</i> be able to export my animation as a bunch of frames with an alpha applied</p>
    <img id="small" src="../photos/p2/sketches.webp">
    <p>from here, i'm just working on a pretty simple model. I don't want to make anything too complicated since the animation itself will be a struggle to make, and the animation is the true project, not the model.</p>
    <p>it only took me two weeks, four lost textures and a , but i've finally rigged my little guy, i'm debating giving him hair but honestly this has taken me so long that i might just animate him as is.</p>
    <p>ok this is starting to take a lot longer than i thought it would. you'd think a few days off would make it easier to work, but it seems my brain is under the assumption that break is here and refuses to do any meaningfull work : (</p>
    <p>i have been able to trick it into working on it more, but i still have some ways to go</p>
    <h2>as of now i have</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>retouching the animation to make sure nothing breaks (a lot did)</li>
        <li>redoing the voice acting to match the movement better</li>
        <li>rendering on my underpowered dusty pc</li>
        <li>dropping everything into premiere and potentually adding folley or not i haven't decided yet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>"the thing about the verge of success is that it often looks like the verge of faliure."</h2>
    <h3>-me, right now</h3>

    <p>it's time to throw the towel in the ring so to speak, except this time it's the blender project in the dropbox</p>
    <p>i was NOT able to finish the animation in time, i am way over deadline and i have to submit something, so here is what i have up to the 970th frame, no voice acting, no background, no coin that i couldn't figure out how to get the texture of.</p>
    <p>i will try to finish it as a personal project, as i have spent too much time on it to give up entierly, but blender has become a beast i am enamoured by. I see the potention of self expression and unique project that are possible in the software, and i must learn to play to it's strengths to make it do what i want.</p>
    <p>for now, i leave you with this, an unfinished animation that took me weeks of obsession and borderline insanity to make work, and will take you just a minute to judge and dismiss.</p>
