    <h3>Exercise 1.2: Keychain</h3>
    
    


    <p>For our first project, we had to make a keychain using Fusion 360.</p>
    <p>For my keychain, I decided to make the smiley watertower from Longport, New Jersey, as a picture of it is used as the cover for an album I love.</p>

        <p>I had relized midway through that my calculations were off, and I was worried that the final product wouldn't fit on a key ring, but after scaling it down in PursaSlicer I was pleasently surprized with how it came out!</p>

    <h3>1.3 3d Fixit / Project 1: 3d Design Project</h3>
    <p>This started out as my fixit project, but the hinges were so hard to figure out that it took me weeks to make, therefore it ended up as both my fixit and my project 1, whoops.</p>
    <p>This project was designed for my friend Stella, because she carried her hard drive in a tubberware container, and I wanted to make something more convinient for her to have in her bag.</p>
    <p>I started with a simple box that would be able to contain the drive, and then spent 3 excruciating weeks trying to make a hinge.</p>

    <p> I was pretty happy with how the model turned out, but i later learned that because the hinge i designed was meant to be printed as a part of the base, it would have to be printed open with the holes down, and therefore the supports would have to print itself inside the holder, which would not only be a waste of plastic but also would be impossible to remove afterwards.</p>
    <p>So, instead i pivoted and changed from a closed hinge to a hole that i would fill in after it was printed.</p>

    <p>I left a hole just big enough that I could fit the fillament through, i just had to figure out that part after i printed the base.</p>

    <p>So Bruce handed me a soddering rod and explained how he had never done it before and then left me unattended to use it for the first time. I ended up accidentally burning a bit of the model, but i got it all together in working order, plus nothing caught on fire!</p>
