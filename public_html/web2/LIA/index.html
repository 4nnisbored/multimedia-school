    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>hi, this website exists to go through my history with photography, revisit different points in my life, and to answer the question "am i actually any good at taking pictures?"</p>
    <h3>earlier days</h3>
    <p>I've enjoyed taking pictures since i was a kid. I started with a Nikon Coolpix S200, which i still have to this day, and a iPhone 4 that i borrowed on occasion</p>
    <p>unfortunately most of my pictures from back then are lost to time (or to the iPhone's dead battery), but it's something that always facinated me.</p>
    <p>i mostly only allowed to use the camera on trips, so there aren't many pictures left from that time</p>
    <p>here are a few interesting ones i've been able to salvage from old rips</p>
    </article>

            <figcaption>not a very good wide view of the city, but i remember going here. i've long forgotten the name by now, and i was only 6, i remember having to drive up a very small road with no railing, where it was not very difficult to drive off and crash off the mountain. terrifying drive, okay village.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>i have NO clue how i could have taken this picture. if the date is to be trused i was 8. i vaguely remember this parade in boticas, mostly cause my mother made such a big deal about it, but i don't know how i could have gotten close enough for a shot like this.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>this one was worth including, i can remember if the shine was an internional part of the picture or not, but i think it gave an interesting quality to it, unfortunately it's very blurry so i wouldn't call it a "good" picture.</figcaption>

    <h5>i can still recall, our</h5>
    <h2>last summer (2024)</h2>
    <p>at the end of the school year i decided to bring back the digicam, in order to try and take pictues again</p>
    <p>i then took this on my unfortunate trip to portugal, which was miserable, but i got some half decent pictures out of it.</p>
    <p>when i was forced to make an instagram i decided to dump a few of these pictures into a post, seen below</p>

            <figcaption>one of the first photos i took with my camera, an interesting sky scene taken while a kid was out with their kite, i found the contrast made for an interesting scene, unfortunately it would take a while before i learned to properly focus with my camera</figcaption>

            <figcaption>one of the only times i've used the flash on the camera, i took one without the flash and it was way too dark to properly see the statue, so i took a chance not expecting anything good to come from it. i'm quite proud of it :)</figcaption>

        <h2>now (2nd semester)</h2>
    <p>Photography, as i do it today, is a newer thing, since i only got this camera a few months ago, so i don't have many examples, but i've more or less learned how the camera works and how to properly use it's settings and focus the lens to get what i want.</p>

            <figcaption>this dark shot with a lit window just bearly showing a staircase. i do love taking darker pictures such as these, and you may see more random lights in dark places. i think it provides in an interesting contrast well having a very simple subject</figcaption>
