        <h2>"NGE.1.2 Create a high quality project"</h2>
        <p>for the index of my site, i wanted to make it simple but still refined and interesting enough to be more than just a wall of links, with clear organization so that everything can be found easily</p>
        <p>i would say that i achieved a level 6 with this capyskill, as i was able to make an index that simply organized my exercises and projects, and was able to take bruce's advice to split them into two grids in order to seperate the important links from the not so important links.</p>
